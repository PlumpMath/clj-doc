h1. clj-doc: Clojure HTML documentation generator.

@clj-doc@ generates HTML documentation for Clojure source code. The generated docs are searchable via JavaScript and include inline source snippets for the code that defined each var.

h2. Example Docs

You can see example docs generated from recent recent Clojure and Clojure Contrib sources by opening @example/index.html@ in your browser.

h2. Setup

To generate your own docs, you will need the following dependencies:

* "clojure.jar":http://clojure.jar
* "clojure-contrib.jar":http://clojure.org
* "clj-html.jar":http://github.com/mmcgrana/clj-html
* "clj-html-helpers.jar":http://github.com/mmcgrana/clj-html-helpers

You will also need @clj-doc.jar@, which you can produce by invoking @ant@.

h2. Basic Usage

You can use the built-in @clojure_gen.clj@ script to generate HTML docs for Clojure and the main libraries in Clojure-Contrib:

<pre><code>
clj clj-doc/bin/clojure_gen.clj /path/to/output
open /path/to/output/index.html
</code></pre>

To generate docs for a different set of libs, create your own script based on @clojure_gen.clj@. Note that any libs that you are documenting will need to be in your classpath, in addition to the dependencies of @clj-doc@ itself.

Reads from *in* which must either be an

  supporting .unread and collapsing all of CR, LF, and CRLF into a single
  \newline. repl-read:
    - skips whitespace, then
      - returns request-prompt on start of line, or
      - returns request-exit on end of stream, or
      - reads an object from the input stream, then

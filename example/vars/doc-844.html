   Handles optional docstrings and attribute maps for a name to be defined
   in a list of macro arguments. If the first macro argument is a string,
   it is added as a docstring to name and removed from the macro argument
   list. If afterwards the first macro argument is a map, its entries are
   added to the name's metadata map and the map is removed from the
   macro argument list. The return value is a vector containing the name
   with its extended metadata map and the list of unprocessed macro
   arguments.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; clojure/contrib/def.clj:94

'fcase' is short for 'function case'.</p><p>The 'compare-fn' is a fn of two arguments.</p><p>The 'test-expr-clauses' are value-expression pairs without
  surrounding parentheses, like in Clojure's 'cond'.</p><p>The 'case-value' is evaluated once and cached.  Then, 'compare-fn'
  is called once for each clause, with the clause's test value as its
  first argument and 'case-value' as its second argument.  If
  'compare-fn' returns logical true, the clause's expression is
  evaluated and returned.  If 'compare-fn' returns false/nil, we go to
  the next test value.</p><p>If 'test-expr-clauses' contains an odd number of items, the last
  item is the default expression evaluated if no case-value matches.
  If there is no default expression and no case-value matches, fcase
  returns nil.</p><p>See specific forms of this macro in 'case' and 're-case'.</p><p>The test expressions in 'fcase' are always evaluated linearly, in
  order.  For a large number of case expressions it may be more
  efficient to use a hash lookup.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; fcase.clj:28

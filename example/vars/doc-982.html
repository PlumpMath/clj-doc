  Adds a watcher to an agent/atom/var/ref reference. The watcher must
  be an Agent, and the action a function of the agent's state and one
  additional arg, the reference. Whenever the reference's state
  changes, any registered watchers will have their actions
  sent. send-type must be one of :send or :send-off. The actions will
  be sent after the reference's state is changed. Var watchers are
  triggered only by root binding changes, not thread-local set!s</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; core.clj:1165

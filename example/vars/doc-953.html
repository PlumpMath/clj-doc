  :max-history (default 10)</p><p>If metadata-map is supplied, it will be come the metadata on the
  ref. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one
  argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state
  change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should
  return false or throw an exception. validate-fn will be called on
  transaction commit, when all refs have their final values.</p><p>Normally refs accumulate history dynamically as needed to deal with
  read demands. If you know in advance you will need history you can
  set :min-history to ensure it will be available when first needed (instead
  of after a read fault). History is limited, and the limit can be set
  with :max-history.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; clojure/core.clj:1312

Evaluates each test
  one at a time. If a test returns logical true, cond-let evaluates and
  returns expr with binding-form bound to the value of test and doesn't
  evaluate any of the other tests or exprs. To provide a default value
  either provide a literal that evaluates to logical true and is
  binding-compatible with binding-form, or use :else as the test and don't
  refer to any parts of binding-form in the expr. (cond-let binding-form)
  returns nil.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; cond.clj:16

<div class="doc-item" id="doc-957"><h2 class="doc-item-name">*print-length*<span class="namespace">(clojure.core)</span></h2><div class="var-docstring"><p>*print-length* controls how many items of each collection the
  printer will print. If it is bound to logical false, there is no
  limit. Otherwise, it must be bound to an integer indicating the maximum
  number of items of each collection to print. If a collection contains
  more items, the printer will print items up to the limit followed by
  '...' to represent the remaining items. The root binding is nil
  indicating no limit.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; core_print.clj:15

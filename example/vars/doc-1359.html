  are held until the action completes (changes the agent's
  state). This function can be used to dispatch any pending sent
  actions immediately. This has no impact on actions sent during a
  transaction, which are still held until commit. If no action is
  occurring, does nothing. Returns the number of actions dispatched.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; core.clj:1156

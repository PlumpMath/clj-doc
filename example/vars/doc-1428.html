         sub-process's stdin.  
  :out   option may be given followed by :bytes or a String. If a String 
         is given, it will be used as a character encoding name (for 
         example &quot;UTF-8&quot; or &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;) to convert the 
         sub-process's stdout to a String which is returned.
         If :bytes is given, the sub-process's stdout will be stored in 
         a byte array and returned. 
  :return-map
         when followed by boolean true returns a map of
           :exit =&gt; sub-process's exit code
           :out  =&gt; sub-process's stdout (as byte[] or String)
           :err  =&gt; sub-process's stderr (as byte[] or String)
  :env   override the process env with a map (or the underlying Java
         String[] if you are masochist).
  :dir   override the process dir with a String or java.io.File.</p><p>You can bind :env or :dir for multiple operations using with-sh-env
  and with-sh-dir.</p></div><div class="var-source"><pre>; shell_out.clj:78
